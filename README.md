# ClearDownloadsPlugin

With the updated google chrome and firefox browsers, you now have to go through a few clicks to clear your downloads.
This can be annoying for an impatient person like me.

This simple extension allows you to clear your downloads with one click :)

## Install

- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clear-downloads-plugin/)
- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cleardownloads-plugin/okkpnkhmlpilfilmflchpbmkbcegiaeo)
